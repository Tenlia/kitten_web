Developers: Elizabeth and Val

### Elizabeth's work:


### Val's work:
- gather and track requirements.
- create directories and html scaffolds.
- Code css and html for the content section of about.html.
  NOTE: Currently about.html uses its own style sheet, and includes code for global styles. A more complete version should remove the global styles, so that the site has only one instance of global style coding.
